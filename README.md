# Tiny Trello Clone

- There would be three sections - ToDo, In Progress and Completed
- At the top of the ToDo section, there is a + button. Clicking on it will add a card in the ToDo section, which is contenteditable. Click on it to add text content and hitting enter when editing will exit out from editing.
- The cards can be dragged from each section to the other, by clicking on their titlebar
- A card can be deleted by clicking on an “X” button in the title bar.
